This is similar to what a baker does when he kneads     bread, hence the name (boulanger is the french word for baker).  \end{itemize}    Both transforms retain all the information in the picture, so it is   always possible to retrieve the original image by applying the   reverse transform. Moreover, these transforms are periodic: After a   given number of iterations, the original image comes back.    \BouMaton is able to apply these transforms and their reverse   transforms any number of times to a picture. It also computes the   periods of the transforms, and keeps a history of the transforms   so far applied. It can also save the resulting picture in JPEG format   if the necessary Java classes are available on your computer.    \section{Quick start}  \BouMaton is a Java application. On many platforms, double-clicking   the \filename{BouMaton.jar} file will launch it. In a command-line   shell, use \verb|java -jar BouMaton.jar| to launch \BouMaton. On   Mac~OS~X, double-click the \filename{BouMaton} application (but you   can also use the \filename{BouMaton.jar} archive or the command line).    Once \BouMaton is running, select the \menu{Open...} item in the  \menu{File} menu to open a picture.  The formats allowed for the  pictures are those supported by the \filename{javax.imageio}  package: at least jpeg, gif and png.    Click the \menu{boulanger} or \menu{photomaton} button, or select  the corresponding item in the \menu{Transforms} menu to apply a  transform to the picture.  You can set the number of iterations  (negative for reverse transforms) in the text field between the two  buttons.    If you started the computation of a large number of transforms on a   big picture and find that it takes too much time to complete, you can   interrupt the computation with the \menu{Interrupt} item of the   \menu{Transforms} menu.    \section{A more detailed description}  The main window of \BouMaton contains the following items:  \begin{center}    \sffamily    \begin{overpic}[%                    scale=.4,                    %grid                   ]{vue_generale}      \put(-10,80){\makebox(0,0)[br]{picture view}}      \put(-10,80){\vector(2,-1){25}}      %      \put(-10,20){\makebox(0,0)[br]{period computation progress}}      \put(-10,20){\vector(3,-1){12}}      %      \put(-10,12){\makebox(0,0)[br]{boulanger transform button}}      \put(-10,12){\vector(4,-1){12}}      %      \put(20,-2){\makebox(0,0)[tr]{picture dimensions}}      \put(20,-2){\vector(1,2){8}}      %      \put(36,-2){\makebox(0,0)[tl]{number of iterations}}      \put(35,-2){\vector(0,1){8}}      %      \put(80,12){\makebox(0,0)[bl]{photomaton transform button}}      \put(80,12){\vector(-4,-1){10}}      %      \put(80,20){\makebox(0,0)[bl]{period of the photomaton transform}}      \put(80,20){\vector(-3,-1){17}}    \end{overpic}  \end{center}  \vspace{2cm}    The picture view area displays the result of applying the transforms   to the picture. The period computation progress bar indicates that   the period of the boulanger transform of this picture is being   computed. When the computation is over, the progress bar is replaced   by the value of the period.    The \menu{boulanger} and \menu{photomaton} buttons trigger the   computation of the corresponding transform, applied as many times as   indicated in the number of iterations text field.    On the right side, you can see the period of the photomaton transform   for this picture (which is much faster to compute than the period of   the boulanger transform).    In the following example, the view displays the result of the   photomaton transform applied once to the original picture, and the   program is computing 500 iterations of the photomaton transform.  The picture view area does not display a live update of the picture  as it is being transformed, since this would slow down the  computation too much. The view is updated only when the computation  of the transforms is over. This is why in this example, you see the  result of the photomaton transform applied only once to the original  picture, even if more than half of 500 requested iterations have  already been computed.    \begin{center}    \sffamily    \begin{overpic}[%                    scale=.4,                    %grid                   ]{photomaton}      \put(-10,12){\makebox(0,0)[br]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          disabled because a transform is being computed        }%      }}      \put(-10,12){\vector(4,-1){12}}      %      \put(30,-17){\makebox(0,0)[t]{500 iterations requested}}      \put(30,-15){\vector(1,4){5}}      %      \put(80,12){\makebox(0,0)[bl]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          disabled because a transform is being computed        }%      }}      \put(80,15){\vector(-4,-1){17}}      %      \put(80,0){\makebox(0,0)[tl]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          progress of the computation of the 500 iterations of the           photomaton transform        }%      }}      \put(80,0){\vector(-4,1){14}}    \end{overpic}  \end{center}    \vspace{2cm}    The behavior for the boulanger transform is similar. In the  following example, the view displays the result of the boulanger  transform applied once to the original picture, and the program is  computing 500 iterations of the boulanger transform:  \begin{center}    \sffamily    \begin{overpic}[%                    scale=.4,                    %grid                   ]{boulanger}      \put(-10,12){\makebox(0,0)[br]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          disabled because a transform is being computed        }%      }}      \put(-10,12){\vector(4,-1){12}}      %      \put(30,-17){\makebox(0,0)[t]{500 iterations requested}}      \put(30,-15){\vector(1,4){5}}      %      \put(80,12){\makebox(0,0)[bl]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          disabled because a transform is being computed        }%      }}      \put(80,15){\vector(-4,-1){17}}      %      \put(-10,0){\makebox(0,0)[tr]{%        \parbox{70\unitlength}{%          progress of the computation of the 500 iterations of the           boulanger transform        }%      }}      \put(-10,0){\vector(4,1){10}}    \end{overpic}  \end{center}    \vspace{2cm}  \section{Saving pictures}  Since version 1.4, \BouMaton requires at least Java~1.4 to run, but  is able to save pictures in either JPEG or PNG format.    The JPEG format yields smaller files for photographs but ignores details  that are considered less important due to the way human eyes work.  When you save a file in JPEG format, you can choose how much  information will be discarded by setting the quality of the saved  picture.  The setting ranges from 0 (very aggressive compression,  small file, very low quality), to 100 (weakest compression, large  file, but high quality).  To help you in this choice, \BouMaton can  compute the estimated size of the file with the current quality  setting if you click the \menu{Compute file size} button in this  dialog.  If the estimated file size is lower than the size of the  original JPEG file, your setting is too low.  If it is much higher,  your setting is too high.  However, since the transforms make the  picture more and more complex, it is normal that the estimated size  grows when you save successively transformed pictures with the same  quality setting.    The PNG format discards no information. Therefore, pictures saved   in this format tend to use much more disk space than pictures saved   in the JPEG format. However, PNG uses a lossless compression   algorithm that is more efficient than JPEG compression for pictures   that contain only lines and large areas of a uniform color. Since   the PNG format does not discard information, you should use it to   save transformed pictures that you want to restore to their   original form later by applying inverse transforms.  %   \section{Saving pictures as JPEG}%   If \BouMaton found the necessary classes on your computer, the%   \menu{Save...} item in the \menu{File} menu is enabled and allows%   you to save the marvelous results of your playing with \BouMaton.%   The only supported format for saving pictures is JPEG. This format%   reduces the size of the picture file by ignoring details which are%   considered less important due to the way human eyes work. When you%   save a picture to a file, \BouMaton displays a dialog to let you set%   how aggressive you want JPEG compression to be. The setting ranges%   from 0 (very aggressive compression, small file, very low quality),%   to 100 (weakest compression, large file, but high quality). To help%   you in this choice, \BouMaton can compute the estimated size of%   the file with the current quality setting if you click the%   \menu{Compute file size} button in this dialog. If the estimated%   file size is lower than the size of the original JPEG file, your%   setting is too low. If it is much higher, your setting is too high.%   However, since the transforms make the picture more and more%   complex, it is normal that the estimated size grows when you save%   successively transformed pictures with the same quality setting.    \section{History of the transforms}  \BouMaton keeps track of all the transforms you have applied to a   picture. You can view this history by selecting the \menu{Show history}   item in the \menu{Transforms} menu:  \begin{center}    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{history}  \end{center}  Consecutive identical transforms are merged in the history, so that   two successive photomaton transforms make only one entry in the   history. Each entry shows the nature of the transform, the number of   iterations, the effective number of iterations computed, and the   time used to compute them. The effective number of iterations may be   less than the required number since computing 3225 iterations of a   transform which has a period of 3222 for the picture is exactly the   same as computing only 3 iterations (but takes more time!). With the   same period, if you ask for 3200 iterations, \BouMaton will compute   22 iterations of the reverse transform since this is much faster.    You can always revert to the original picture by choosing the   \menu{Revert} item of the \menu{File} menu. This also clears the history.    \section{Information about the transforms}  While computing the periods of the transforms, \BouMaton gathers   information about the period of individual pixels. During successive   transforms, each pixel follows an orbit (it goes from place to place   in the picture) and may come back to its original position well   before the whole picture is restored. The period of the transform for   the picture is the smallest number of iterations such that each pixel   has completed a whole number of turns on its own orbit.    It may happen that after a given number of iterations of a   transform, many pixels are back to their original position, so that   the original image seems to appear again in the otherwise   random-looking set of pixels.    Selecting the \menu{Show info} item of the \menu{Transform} menu   will display all the information gathered so far about both transforms.   Information about the boulanger transform is quite long to compute   and won't be displayed until the period of the transform is computed.    \begin{center}    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{info}  \end{center}  This example shows the information for a \picdim{360}{400} picture   (the periods depend only on the geometry of the picture). We can see   that the period of the boulanger transform is quite big, but that   after 67911 iterations, 47.16\,\% of the pixels are back to their   original position.    \section{Examples}  The following series of pictures show the evolution of an image for  both transforms, from the original through pictures where all  information seems to be lost and others where ghosts of the original   appear, and finally back to the original.    \subsection{Iterations of the photomaton transform}  {\sffamily\small  \begin{tabular}{@{}*5{p{0.18\textwidth}}@{}}    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p1}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p3}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p8}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p179}    \\      original picture    & after one iteration    & after 3 iterations    & after 8 iterations    & something appears after 179 iterations    \\[10pt]    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p180}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p_6}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p_2}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_p_1}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example}    \\      close to the original after 180 iterations    & 6 iterations before the original    & 2 iterations before the original    & 1 iteration before the original    & back to the original after 3222 iterations  \end{tabular}  }    \subsection{Iterations of the boulanger transform}  {\sffamily\small  \begin{tabular}{@{}*5{p{0.18\textwidth}}@{}}    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b1}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b4}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b20}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b27656}    \\      original picture    & after one iteration    & after 4 iterations    & after 20 iterations    & 19.2\% pixels are in place after 27656 iterations    \\[10pt]    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b67911}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b_6}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b_2}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_b_1}    &    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example}    \\      47.2\% pixels are in place after 67911 iterations    & 6 iterations before the original    & 2 iterations before the original    & 1 iteration before the original    & back to the original after {\tiny 896568225229163143800} iterations  \end{tabular}  }    \section{Licence}  \newlength{\savedindent}  \setlength{\savedindent}{\parindent}  \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}  \newlength{\savedskip}  \setlength{\savedskip}{\parskip}  \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}    \BouMaton is copyright Frédéric Boulanger 1997-2006, all rights   reserved.    \BouMaton and its source code may be freely redistributed as long as  it is not modified and that the distribution includes this   documentation.

This article described the   photomaton and the boulanger transforms, and I started coding these   transforms in C. To avoid writing a real application, I used the   plug-in API of GraphicConverter, a very smart application for Mac~OS   which reads and writes almost any picture file   (\url{http://www.lemkesoft.com/us_gcabout.html}). The result was two   plug-ins named \filename{PhotoMaton} and \filename{Boulanger}   (\url{http://wwwsi.supelec.fr/fb/Development.html#progs}).    GraphicConverter switched to Carbon when Mac~OS~X appeared, and   instead of converting my plug-ins to Carbon, I decided to write a   Java application combining the functionalities of both plug-ins.   This allowed me to keep a history of the transforms applied to a   picture and to display information concerning the period for the whole   image and for individual pixels. Using BigIntegers, I was able to   fix a bug in the computation of the period of the boulanger   transform which often overflows unsigned long integers.    The result is \BouMaton, and I hope that the users of the   GraphicConverter plug-ins will appreciate it, and that Windows and   Unix users will benefit from the ``write once, execute anywhere''   Java motto.    \medskip    \noindent Version 1.0 is the first public release of \BouMaton.  \par\smallskip  \noindent Version 1.1 fixes a picture update issue.  \par\smallskip  \noindent Version 1.2 improves low-memory conditions handling and  adds a dialog to set the JPEG compression quality when saving a picture.  \par\smallskip  \noindent Version 1.3 uses a new algorithm to compute the period of   the boulanger transform more quickly.  \par\smallskip  \noindent Version 1.4 uses the javax.imageio package and adds  support for saving pictures in PNG.  \par\smallskip  \noindent Version 1.5 fixes a problem with reading PNG images.    \section{Technical details\label{sec:tech-details}}  This section explains technical details of \BouMaton and may be   ignored safely by casual users.    \subsection{Translations of \BouMaton}  The manual of \BouMaton is written in \LaTeX. You can start from the   English or French versions of the manual and translate it into another   language. You should then identify yourself as the translator.    The strings used in \BouMaton can also be translated into other   languages. The jar file contains a   \filename{BouMatonStrings.properties} file which is for the English   (default) version. The \filename{BouMatonStrings\_fr.properties}   file is used when the default locale specifies the French language.   If you want to translate \BouMaton into another language, you have   to write a \filename{BouMatonStrings\_<lang>.properties} file, where   \filename{<lang>} is the locale code for your language (for instance   \filename{de} for German, \filename{it} for Italian and so on). The   easiest way to write this file is to start with a copy of one of   files I wrote for English and for French, and to translate each   phrase which is on the right side of the first ``='' sign on a line.  The file must be added to the jar file for the new strings to be used   when the corresponding locale is active.    If you write a translation for your language, please send me the file   so that I can put it in a future release of \BouMaton. A translated   manual would be appreciated too.    \subsection{The boulanger transform}  The stretching of the picture in the boulanger transform   is done by interleaving the pixels of odd lines with the pixels   of even lines. The folding is done by cutting the stretched picture   at its original width, and by rotating the right part around its   lower left corner, as shown below for a \picdim{4}{4} picture:    \begin{center}    \newcommand{\pixbox}[2]{\makebox(1,1){\textsf{\scriptsize(#1,#2)}}}    \newcounter{pixx}    \newcounter{pixy}    \newcounter{pixnum}    \newcommand{\dopixbox}[2]{%      \put(\thepixx,\thepixy){\pixbox{#1}{#2}}%      \stepcounter{pixx}%      \bouline{\thepixy}{\thepixx}{\thepixnum}%    }    \newcommand{\bouline}[3]{%      \let\next=\relax      \ifnum#2<#3        \setcounter{pixy}{#1}%        \setcounter{pixx}{#2}%        \setcounter{pixnum}{#3}%        \let\next=\dopixbox      \fi      \next    }    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.5cm}    \begin{picture}(22,4)      \put(0,0){\framebox(4,4){}}      \multiput(0,1)(0,1){3}{\line(1,0){4}}      \multiput(1,0)(1,0){3}{\line(0,1){4}}      \bouline{3}{0}{4} 0 0  0 1  0 2  0 3      \bouline{2}{0}{4} 1 0  1 1  1 2  1 3      \bouline{1}{0}{4} 2 0  2 1  2 2  2 3      \bouline{0}{0}{4} 3 0  3 1  3 2  3 3      %%      \put(5,2){\vector(1,0){1}}      %%      \qbezier(0.5,3.9)(6,5)(7.5,2.9)\put(7.5,2.9){\circle*{0.12}}      \qbezier(0.5,2.1)(6,1)(8.5,2.1)\put(8.5,2.1){\circle*{0.12}}      %%      \put(7,1){\framebox(8,2){}}      \put(7,2){\line(1,0){8}}      \multiput(8,1)(1,0){7}{\line(0,1){2}}      \bouline{2}{7}{15} 0 0  1 0  0 1  1 1  0 2  1 2  0 3  1 3      \bouline{1}{7}{15} 2 0  3 0  2 1  3 1  2 2  3 2  2 3  3 3      %%      \put(16,2){\vector(1,0){1}}      %%      \put(11,1){\circle*{0.25}}      \put(11,0.9){\oval(3.5,3)[br]}      \put(11,-0.6){\vector(-1,0){0.5}}           %%      \put(18,0){\framebox(4,4){}}      \multiput(18,1)(0,1){3}{\line(1,0){4}}      \multiput(19,0)(1,0){3}{\line(0,1){4}}      \bouline{3}{18}{22} 0 0  1 0  0 1  1 1      \bouline{2}{18}{22} 2 0  3 0  2 1  3 1      \bouline{1}{18}{22} 3 3  2 3  3 2  2 2      \bouline{0}{18}{22} 1 3  0 3  1 2  0 2      %%      \put(22,2){\circle*{0.25}}      \put(22.2,2){\oval(3,3)[br]}\put(22.2,0.5){\vector(-1,0){0.1}}    \end{picture}  \end{center}  There is no loss of information in this transform, and after a  number of iterations, the original image comes back. However, I  don't know of a formula to compute this number for all pictures. For  a \(2^m\) by \(2^m\) image, the original comes back after \(2m+1\)  iterations. For a \(2^m\) by \(2^n\) image, you must wait for  \((2m+1)(2n+1)+1\) iterations.  To compute the period of the transform for a given  picture, \BouMaton computes the period \(P(x,y)\) of each pixel  of the picture (the number of iterations after which the pixel comes  back to its original location).  The period \(P\) of the picture is the  smallest common multiple of all \(P(x,y)\).  This computation may  be quite long, and \BouMaton uses a separate thread to make it.   Since the period may be very large (896568225229163143800 for a   \picdim{360}{400} picture), \BouMaton uses BigIntegers to compute   the smallest common multiple of the pixel periods.    Since version 1.3, \BouMaton uses a new algorithm to compute this   period much more quickly than before. When we are computing the   period of a given pixel, we find all the other pixels that belong to   its orbit. All those pixels have the same period since they belong   to the same orbit, therefore, there is no need to compute their   period again. Since there are generally few orbits in a picture,   the number of \(P(x,y)\) periods to compute is dramatically reduced   when using this optimization, and the period of the boulanger   transform is now computed as fast as the period of the photomaton   transform.    \subsection{The photomaton transform}  The photomaton transform splits a picture into what looks like four   identical copies of the original. However, the four copies are not   identical, and the four sub-pictures are obtained by selecting one   pixel in each \picdim{4}{4} square of the original image, as shown   in the following illustration for a \picdim{8}{8} image:  \begin{center}    \newcommand{\pixbox}[2]{\makebox(1,1){\textsf{\scriptsize(#1,#2)}}}%     \newcounter{pixx}%     \newcounter{pixy}%     \newcounter{pixnum}    \newcommand{\dopixbox}[2]{%      \put(\thepixx,\thepixy){\pixbox{#1}{#2}}%      \stepcounter{pixx}%      \pholine{\thepixy}{\thepixx}{\thepixnum}%    }    \newcommand{\pholine}[3]{%      \let\next=\relax      \ifnum#2<#3        \setcounter{pixy}{#1}%        \setcounter{pixx}{#2}%        \setcounter{pixnum}{#3}%        \let\next=\dopixbox      \fi      \next    }    \setlength{\unitlength}{0.5cm}    \begin{picture}(19,9)      \put(0,0){\framebox(8,8){}}      \multiput(1,0)(1,0){7}{\line(0,1){8}}      \multiput(0,1)(0,1){7}{\line(1,0){8}}      \pholine{7}{0}{8} 0 0  0 1  0 2  0 3  0 4  0 5  0 6  0 7      \pholine{6}{0}{8} 1 0  1 1  1 2  1 3  1 4  1 5  1 6  1 7      \pholine{5}{0}{8} 2 0  2 1  2 2  2 3  2 4  2 5  2 6  2 7      \pholine{4}{0}{8} 3 0  3 1  3 2  3 3  3 4  3 5  3 6  3 7      \pholine{3}{0}{8} 4 0  4 1  4 2  4 3  4 4  4 5  4 6  4 7      \pholine{2}{0}{8} 5 0  5 1  5 2  5 3  5 4  5 5  5 6  5 7      \pholine{1}{0}{8} 6 0  6 1  6 2  6 3  6 4  6 5  6 6  6 7      \pholine{0}{0}{8} 7 0  7 1  7 2  7 3  7 4  7 5  7 6  7 7      %      \put(9,4){\vector(1,0){1}}      %      \put(11,0){\framebox(8,8){}}      \multiput(12,0)(1,0){7}{\line(0,1){8}}      \multiput(11,1)(0,1){7}{\line(1,0){8}}      \pholine{7}{11}{19} 0 0  0 2  0 4  0 6  0 1  0 3  0 5  0 7      \pholine{6}{11}{19} 2 0  2 2  2 4  2 6  2 1  2 3  2 5  2 7      \pholine{5}{11}{19} 4 0  4 2  4 4  4 6  4 1  4 3  4 5  4 7      \pholine{4}{11}{19} 6 0  6 2  6 4  6 6  6 1  6 3  6 5  6 7      \pholine{3}{11}{19} 1 0  1 2  1 4  1 6  1 1  1 3  1 5  1 7      \pholine{2}{11}{19} 3 0  3 2  3 4  3 6  3 1  3 3  3 5  3 7      \pholine{1}{11}{19} 5 0  5 2  5 4  5 6  5 1  5 3  5 5  5 7      \pholine{0}{11}{19} 7 0  7 2  7 4  7 6  7 1  7 3  7 5  7 7      %%      \qbezier(0.5,7.9)(8,9)(11.5,7.9)\put(11.5,7.9){\circle*{0.12}}      \qbezier(1.5,7.9)(9,10)(15.5,7.9)\put(15.5,7.9){\circle*{0.12}}      \qbezier(0.5,6.1)(8,3)(11.5,3.1)\put(11.5,3.1){\circle*{0.12}}      \qbezier(1.5,6.1)(8,1)(15.5,3.1)\put(15.5,3.1){\circle*{0.12}}      %%      \thicklines      \put(11,4){\line(1,0){8}}      \put(15,0){\line(0,1){8}}    \end{picture}  \end{center}    Since no information is lost in this transform, and the number of  permutations of the pixels is finite, the original image comes back  after a number of iterations. I don't know of a formula to compute  the period of the photomaton transform for all pictures. For a  \(2^m\) by \(2^n\) picture, the period is the smallest common  multiple of \(m\) and \(n\), so a \picdim{512}{512} image will come  back after 9 iterations, while a \picdim{128}{256} one has a period  of 56.    However, the period of the photomaton transform is much easier to  compute than the period of the boulanger transform because the  period of the \(x\) coordinate of all pixels with the same \(x\)  coordinate is the same (all pixels on a same vertical line are back  on this line at the same time), and the period of the \(y\)  coordinate of all pixels with the same \(y\) coordinate is the same   (all pixels on a horizontal line are back on this line at the same   time).  The period \(P(x,y)\) for a given pixel is the smallest common  multiple of the period for \(x\) and the period for \(y\). The  period for the whole image is the smallest common multiple of all  \(P(x,y)\).    \subsection{Optimizations}  When the period \(P\) of a transform has been computed, \BouMaton  uses it to optimize the computation of \(n\) iterations of the  transform: it computes only \(n \bmod P\) iterations.  If \(n \bmod  P\) is closer to \(P\) than to 0, it computes only \(P - (n \bmod  P)\) iterations of the reverse transform.  Moreover, for each pixel  in the image, \BouMaton uses the period for that pixel in the same  way to optimize the number of iterations to compute.    \subsection{Saving transformed image as JPEG}  \BouMaton allows to save transformed pictures in either JPEG or PNG  format.  We have seen that both transforms keep all the information  that was in the original picture, but since JPEG compression is  lossy, saving a transformed picture in JPEG and loading it later in  \BouMaton to apply the reverse transforms will not yield an exact  copy of the original picture.  The global aspect of the picture will  be preserved, but colors may be washed out since JPEG compression  will have discarded information which seemed not to be critical in  the transformed image. There is no such problem with the PNG format   since it does not discard any information. \end{document}
